Bye Bye LinkedIn (Ionic + Firebase + Github)
=========================

Simple concept that grew out of a nodeconf.eu session. LinkedIn is great for
recruiters, but provides little for the dev. Most of what we do is visible on
gitub, and our relationships are managed on Twitter. So why not find a way to
swap the LinkedIn Connections for Github follower/following?

This is a simple ionic app, using firebase and github to manage github centric
relationships.

Its still very beta. Use on your own risk. If there is enough utility then this
will go to the app stores. Maybe.
